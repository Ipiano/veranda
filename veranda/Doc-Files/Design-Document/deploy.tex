\chapter{Release -- Setup -- Deployment}
\section{Deployment Information and Dependencies}
The project requires ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco, Qt 5.12 or later, CMake 3.28+, and a C++17 compiler. See the README.md and User Manual for detailed installation instructions.

The project is built from source using the Colcon build system with ament\_cmake. GitHub Actions provides automated builds for Ubuntu 24.04 and Windows.

\section{Setup Information}
Once the development environment is set up, create a folder to be your ROS workspace. Within the workspace, create a \lstinline|src| folder. Within \lstinline|src|, clone the project repository.

\subsection*{Building}
In a terminal \lstinline|source| (\lstinline|call| on Windows) the \lstinline|setup.bash/.bat| file for your ROS 2 Jazzy installation. On Ubuntu 24.04, this is typically \lstinline|/opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash|. From the workspace root, run \lstinline|colcon build --symlink-install|. This will build the project.

\subsection*{Running}
To run the project, \lstinline|source|/\lstinline|call| the \lstinline|setup.bash/.bat| file in the \lstinline|install| subfolder of the workspace. Then, run \lstinline|ros2 run veranda_qt_frontend veranda|
